== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I edit a username? =

Go to Users in the WordPress admin, click on the user you want to edit, and you will see the username field is editable. Change it and click "Update User".

= Can I edit my own username? =

No. For security reasons, you cannot edit your own username. Another administrator must make the change for you.

= Can I edit a Super Admin's username? =

By default, editing Super Admin usernames is disallowed. However, there is a setting under Settings > General to enable editing of admin usernames if needed.

= Will editing a username break anything? =

No. The plugin updates all references to the previous username, including comment author names. The user's posts, pages, and other content remain intact.

= What languages are supported? =

The plugin is available in 30 languages with more being added regularly. We are working toward supporting 50 languages total!
